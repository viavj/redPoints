Features: 
  1: Pagination
  2:search by title, sorting
  3: you can save the movie as favorite which will be added to https://www.themoviedb.org/u/passedByMe/favorites
  4: remove them
  5: modal containeng favorite movies
  6: after comming back from some movie's page to home page, parameters you set before 'filtered movies by tiitle, some sort       parameter, page where you was' will be set back.
  
  It would be nice to have 'isFavorite' property in 'movie' object. Since it's not there, i have to get the list of favorite movies first, then get the list of 'popular/filtered by title' movies so i can attach 'favorite icon' to them.
